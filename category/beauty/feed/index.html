</p>
<div class="article-body js-article-body">
<p>hello, today i thought i would tell you all a story about how i lost my best friend.
</p>
<figure class="embed-grid"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="family, girl, and ulzzang image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/345515784/superthumb.jpg?t=1592509680"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="Image by aremonrrou" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/345520899/superthumb.jpg?t=1592517533"></figure>
<blockquote><p> childhood</p></blockquote>
<p>we had known each other since we were babies, when we were younger, she got quite jealous over me, and got mad at my friends
</p>
<blockquote><p> preteen</p></blockquote>
<p>when we were preteens, i really don&#8217;t know what happened.
</p>
<p>we had a group of friends, one of our &#8220;friends&#8221; would get bullied by the other members in our group including my best friend.
</p>
<p>so obviously my friend group was bad
</p>
<p>sometimes the friend who was being teamed up on would just be our friend, and often when this would happen i would become the target, i would say most of the year i was the target. basically they would just call me names but i was still friends with them? there wasn&#8217;t many girls in my class so they were my only friends, so i had to suffer
</p>
<p>even my best friend would call me these names. twice it became physical, one of those times it was my best friend doing it.
</p>
<p>this is when my anxiety and depression started and i stopped going to school, and i started doing really bad.
</p>
<p>before high school i tried to get rid of my best friend but she wouldn&#8217;t leave me, she literally told me i was never going to get rid of her.. at the time i was annoyed but over time i felt like she was the only person i had
</p>
<figure class="embed-grid"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="friendships, friends, and sofia jamora image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/345518025/superthumb.jpg?t=1592513225"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="family, girl, and ulzzang image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/345514724/superthumb.jpg?t=1592508054"></figure>
<blockquote><p> high school</p></blockquote>
<p>my depression got worse and i stopped showing up to school less often so i had almost no friends besides her
</p>
<p>my best friend always got caught up in the bad crowd, bad things kept happening to her and she became depressed as well
</p>
<p>around this time i confronted her about what she did to me before high school and completely denied everything, saying she never bullied me, called me names, nothing.
</p>
<p>what i now notice is that, she kind of has this selective memory, when people do bad things to her she remembers it and keeps a grudge and tries to get back at them, but when she does something bad she forgets
</p>
<p>when i was friends with her i was aware that if i ended the friendship with her she would probably do something bad to me
</p>
<p>i am bisexual and im still in the closet to my family, i was almost sure she would tell them, luckily she didn&#8217;t
</p>
<figure class="embed-grid"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="friends, friendship, and aesthetic image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/345524601/superthumb.jpg?t=1592524102"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="aesthetic, outfit, and fashion image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/345526013/superthumb.jpg?t=1592527628"></figure>
<p>anyways
</p>
<p>she dated alot, her most recent boyfriend was homophobic, clearly that didn&#8217;t sit well with me..
</p>
<p>so heres how i ended the friendship.. my best friend had a gay male friend and her boyfriend threatened his life, so i was done, i just told her i wanted to be done
</p>
<p>i hated her boyfriend, and no matter what she would choose her boyfriend over me, every boyfriend shes had always came before me so our friendship ended. like it should have had, years ago
</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>10 Habits To Start Your Morning Right 10 Habits To Start Your Morning Right </p>
</p>
<div class="article-body js-article-body">
<p>Hi everybody! Today&#8217;s article is all about how to start your morning right. The morning plays such a big role in determining how the rest of your day goes. So, how can you make sure it&#8217;s awesome? Start doing these things!
</p>

<blockquote><p>P.S. I started an Instagram! It&#8217;s mainly devoted to studying, but if you wanna check it out, here&#8217;s the link! https://www.instagram.com/thefantastically/</p></blockquote>
<h2>1. Make your bed<br />
</h2>
<figure class="embed-large"><img alt="bed, fashion, and girl image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/328520163/original.jpg"></figure>
<p>Making your bed really gets your blood flowing and your mind moving and it helps you to wake up as well. It&#8217;s also just a good habit to keep your room tidy.
</p>
<h2>2. Journal<br />
</h2>
<figure class="embed-large"><img alt="study image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/341889482/original.jpg"></figure>
<p>Journaling can help calm your mind, plan your day, and set the tone. Write down what you&#8217;re grateful for, what you&#8217;re stressed about, any crazy dreams you had&#8230;whatever you want!
</p>
<h2>3. Pray or meditate<br />
</h2>
<figure class="embed-large"><img alt="accessories, beach, and chic image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/340393546/original.jpg"></figure>
<p>Praying and meditating really puts you in a calm and relaxed mood for the day. It helps you connect not only with yourself but also with your spirituality (if you&#8217;re praying).
</p>
<h2>4. Take a shower<br />
</h2>
<figure class="embed-large"><img alt="girls, aesthetic, and body image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/336531174/original.jpg"></figure>
<p>Personally, I love hot morning showers where I just wash my body, not my hair. They wake you up and are so relaxing and detoxifying. Or, if you prefer, take a cold shower to really wake you up.
</p>
<h2>5. Plan your day<br />
</h2>
<figure class="embed-large"><img alt="book, planner, and school image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/345463014/original.jpg"></figure>
<p>I highly recommend using the mornings to grab your planner or to-do list and just write down every little thing you need to get done. That way you&#8217;ll be able to move through the rest of the day mindfully with goals in mind.
</p>
<h2>6. Exercise!<br />
</h2>
<figure class="embed-large"><img alt="fitness, gym, and workout image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/341042150/original.jpg"></figure>
<p>Yep, you probably saw this one coming. I really don&#8217;t like exercising at night because I always feel tired or bloated or rushed and I just think getting it over in the morning is the best. It also helps in waking up your body and mind.
</p>
<h2>7. Eat a healthy breakfast<br />
</h2>
<figure class="embed-large"><img alt="food, banana, and breakfast image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/342362414/original.jpg"></figure>
<p>I love breakfast, mainly because I can make something really delicious- avocado toast? An egg? A smoothie bowl? Chia seed pudding? Smoked salmon? Peanut butter cereal? Matcha? Green tea? Mmmm the opportunities are endless!
</p>
<h2>8. Do yoga or stretch<br />
</h2>
<figure class="embed-large"><img alt="elegance, fashion, and girl image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/314659211/original.jpg"></figure>
<p>If you don&#8217;t really want to exercise, definitely do yoga or stretch. I can 100% guarantee this will get you in the right mindset and help you feel more peaceful and rested as you go through the day. It also wakes up your body less violently than exercise.
</p>
<h2>9. Wake up early<br />
</h2>
<figure class="embed-large"><img alt="girl, reading, and summer image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/344262587/original.jpg"></figure>
<p>There are a lot of benefits to waking up early, but mainly, I would say it lets you get stuff done and feel <em>accomplished</em> and honestly, there&#8217;s nothing better than feeling accomplished.
</p>
<h2>10. Avoid technology<br />
</h2>
<figure class="embed-large"><img alt="Image by A. &#x2728;" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/345461657/original.jpg"></figure>
<p>Last but not least, avoid technology, especially right after you wake up. It&#8217;s distracting and you may end up scrolling through social media for an hour in bed, or wasting time on YouTube. Avoid it for at least 15 minutes.
</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all. Hope you all have a great day!
</p>
<p>&lt;3<br />
<br /><em>fantastically</em>

<div class="article-body js-article-body">
<p>Dear Black Women,<br />
<br />  The last couple of months have been hard for our black community, in the fight for true freedom that the American flag is supposed to symbolize we are everywhere. Black women are in the frontlines, behind the scene, and fighting in our everyday life. I am not going to tell you something you already know. You know the word that they put before &#8220;black woman&#8221; when they&#8217;re describing us. I just want to remind you of all the other things that you are and that you are allowed to be.

<blockquote><p> You are beautiful and the world should know it. The features that you were born with look the best on you. <br />Your body is not a sex symbol but God&#8217;s special creation that can&#8217;t ever be copied and pasted.  Acknowledging how strong you are and how much of a warrior you are is not enough, you deserve statues, holidays to celebrate you, and parades in your honor.<br />Your creativity runs like a stream that never experiences a drought, your mind is to thank for how far that the world has come. <br />Your hair defies gravity and is stronger than tree roots but stretches like tendons in the human body that can mend themselves.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>You are allowed to be weak, and not feel up for the fight.<br />You are allowed to feel pain, to heal, to forgive or not to forgive. <br />You are allowed to love your body, embrace it, and share it with the world if you choose to.<br />You are allowed to love whoever you want</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p> <strong>The sources for this article are various blogs and websites.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>This is the fourth instalment to my <strong>&#8220;skincare tips from&#8221;</strong> series. These are actually one of my favourite ones to write, simply because they can be really helpful for some of you. Till now I&#8217;ve talked about skincare from models, celebs and Korean beauties, but what about the ones who actually know skin inside out.
</p>
<p>It&#8217;s their turn to tell us, what they think is good and what isn&#8217;t.

<h2>here&#8217;s, <em>skincare tips from dermatologists</em><br />
</h2>
<p><strong>Ava Shamban</strong>
</p>
<figure class="embed-large"><img alt="fashion, makeuptutorial, and girls image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/345069611/original.jpg"></figure>
<blockquote><p> “For oily or acne-prone skin, a salicylic gel or benzoyl peroxide wash works great, for dry mature skin, use either a moisturizing glycolic or milky cleanser. For skin with brown spots or melasma, use a brightening wash, such as an alpha hydroxy acid cleanser.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Jesleen Ahluwalia</strong>
</p>
<figure class="embed-large"><img alt="bed, rose gold, and pink image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/268551309/original.jpg"></figure>
<blockquote><p> “Use silk as pillow covers. The material glides easily and prevents creasing and wrinkles, Silk is also easier on hair — it helps avoid tangles and breakage.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Neil Sadick</strong>
</p>
<figure class="embed-large"><img alt="chill, weekends, and eye mask image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/344346639/original.jpg"></figure>
<blockquote><p> “When layering let each product absorb for two or three minutes so it&#8217;s not counteracted or diluted by the next one you put on.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Jessica Wu</strong>
</p>
<figure class="embed-large"><img alt="girl, beauty, and aesthetic image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/342679462/original.jpg"></figure>
<blockquote><p>“Many people (myself included) frown and scrunch their faces at night, leading to frown lines and crows feet. To relax my face, I do facial acupressure for a few minutes at bedtime. Press above your inner eyebrows, temples, and next to your nostrils, holding for 10 seconds each.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Elizabeth Tanzi</strong>
</p>
<figure class="embed-large"><img alt="Image by ✧･ﾟ:Cruella:･ﾟ✧" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/345165822/original.jpg"></figure>
<blockquote><p>“I never wash my face with hot water–it&#8217;s too harsh. Only tepid water at the sink.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Doris Day</strong>
</p>
<figure class="embed-large"><img alt="Image by MiLK0" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/345274970/original.jpg"></figure>
<blockquote><p>“Apply sunscreen to the neck, chest, and hands before the face–these areas age faster and are harder to improve than the face. We often forget to apply sunscreen there even though they&#8217;re exposed as much as the face.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Sarah Lee and Christine Chang</strong>
</p>
<figure class="embed-large"><img alt="beautiful, model, and selfcare image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/343479933/original.jpg"></figure>
<blockquote><p>“We consider treatment steps to be anything between toning and moisturizing. Layering your serums and essences from thinnest to thickest helps the skin to absorb each layer most efficiently!”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Hirsch</strong>
</p>
<figure class="embed-large"><img alt="girl, beauty, and model image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/345486421/original.jpg"></figure>
<blockquote><p>“If your skin is ashy, make one easy change: Don&#8217;t dry it completely before moisturizing. Creams seal in hydration and work best with a little water.”</p></blockquote>

<h2>Hello, my lovely little licornes ~<br />
</h2>
<p>Since I was a child my life has been somehow connected to #art &#8211; any kind of it. I´ve always admired not only the creations themselves but also the process of their making. Especially tools and other things needed for them to be &#8220;brought&#8221; to #life. Tin colour tubes have always made me wonder what´s inside of them and they´ve always seemed magical and mysterious to me. Simply #aesthetic. That´s why I saw these Tony Moly #masks I couldn´t just leave them there and I had to try at least one of them!
</p>
<figure class="embed-large"><img alt="beauty, cosmetics, and korean image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/345394988/original.jpg"></figure>
<p>I chose the blue one &#8211; or better said a turquoise one &#8211; Tony Moly Painting Therapy Pack. Its primal effects are hydration and soothing of the #skin. Consistency of this mask is gel-like and its colour is a very vivid and bright turquoise one <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2665.png" alt="♥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Scent reminds me of something fresh connected with the sea haze. While spreading it on your face you will feel also a refreshing effect. It only leaves a light layer on your skin.
</p>

<p>Did you think the Skincare world was just sheet masks, cleansers, pore strips, etc? Well, I&#8217;m here to show you the best products that if, as me, you are a wh0re for skincare, will be adding to your wishlist immediately. Everything here can be found at amazon <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
</p>
<h2>mini fridge<br />
</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s perfect for keeping your products chilled and at hand. Imagine always feeling refreshed with a cool moisturizer, or the pleasure of a cold mask. Don&#8217;t tell me you don&#8217;t like it!
</p>
<figure class="embed-grid"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="fresh, fridge, and pink cloud image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/345528359/superthumb.jpg?t=1592533715"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="face, fridge, and skin image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/344311255/superthumb.jpg?t=1589838692"><figcaption>It&#8217;s everything: cute, useful, and small enough to stand in your bathroom or vanity desk.</figcaption></figure>
<h2>face roller<br />
</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m sure many of you have heard about this particular gadget. It helps to reduce puffiness, swelling, wrinkles, acne scars, eyebags, and so many more benefits because it improves circulation. And above all, the massage makes you feel like you&#8217;re on a spa day! You can use it when having a sheet mask, after your serum, applying eye cream, you call it!
</p>
<figure class="embed-grid"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="beauty, skin, and care image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/337296487/superthumb.jpg?t=1573555893"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="vanilla candle, jade roller, and guasha image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/328819876/superthumb.jpg?t=1554540729"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="beauty, routine, and quarantine image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/345590379/superthumb.jpg?t=1592678966"><figcaption>There can be made from different stones: <strong>jade</strong> and <strong>quartz</strong> are the most common, each one with its particular benefits.</figcaption></figure>
<h2>scalp massager<br />
</h2>
<p>Even though this is for your head, I personally think that taking care of your scalp is super important. A healthy scalp contributes to strong, healthy hair follicules and so to a shiny and better looking hair, no matter the pattern.
</p>
<figure class="embed-grid"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="scalp massager image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/343160003/superthumb.jpg?t=1587563240"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="beauty, routine, and fashion image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/345590777/superthumb.jpg?t=1592679568"><figcaption>The brush is made of silicone, you can apply it when shampooing for a gentle massage. This improves circulation, removes build up (not so deeply) and relaxes you. Look it up for more benefits!</figcaption></figure>
<h2>guasha<br />
</h2>
<p>This comes along with many face roller kits, though it&#8217;s not as known. This tool is meant for a special face massage: lymphatic drainage, soften tense face muscles, boost blood flow, face sculpting effects. Get the look of a face lift by adding this to your daily routine!
</p>
<figure class="embed-grid"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="routine, face massage, and guasha image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/345591174/superthumb.jpg?t=1592680218"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="crystals, melanin, and jade roller image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/324086539/superthumb.jpg?t=1545404432"><figcaption>Search this tool on pinterest and get to know its magic.</figcaption></figure>
<p>That&#8217;s it for this article! Thank you so much for reading, I hope that like me, you discover all the wonderful things that can help for Selfcare. Remember that a glow up starts from your inside, when you give the most part of your love to yourself.<br />
<br />Remember that you are gorgeous, unique and so full of energy to share!
</p>
<p>I wish you the best vibes! xo

</p>
<div class="article-body js-article-body">
<p><em>Hey guys! I know it&#8217;s been a while since I uploaded an article, I&#8217;m not gonna give you an excuse honestly I&#8217;m just a procrastinator and I need to fix that. Anyways, today I thought that I should share my summer morning routine (quarantine edition) and how I start off my day even when I&#8217;m not going anywhere. I hope you guys enjoy it <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></em>
</p>
<p><strong>1. Waking Up</strong>
</p>
<p><em>Waking up is a pretty interesting process for me to be honest. I usually wake up and lay in my bed for a good 5-10 minutes and take a quick peek at my phone (I&#8217;m trying to stop this). I then proceed to wash my face and brush my teeth and give my body a good stretch. Afterward, I make up my bed and turn on my diffuser</em>
</p>
<div class="js-doubleclick-ad article-inline-ad" id="article-inline" data-ad-unit="WeHeartIt_Article_Inline" data-ad-size="300x250 300x100" data-ad-collapse="true"></div>
<figure class="embed-grid"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="quarantine image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/343755664/superthumb.jpg?t=1588715374"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="yoga, fitness, and workout image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/344873139/superthumb.jpg?t=1591080961"></figure>
<p><strong>2. Food!!</strong>
</p>
<p><em>Then I head into my kitchen and stand in my pantry for a good minute to try and figure out what I want to eat and then I usually settle on some cereal or a couple of pieces of toast with some Nutella on it, along with a cup of green tea if I have some. While eating, I take my vitamins and supplements.</em>
</p>
<figure class="embed-grid"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="food, coffee, and breakfast image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/345518701/superthumb.jpg?t=1592514233"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="beauty, wellness, and hair image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/340951464/superthumb.jpg?t=1582850746"></figure>
<p><strong>3. Exercise</strong>
</p>
<p><em>So during the school year, I took a weight training class and I really wanted to get back into it because I have noticed that my metabolism has slowed down and I have gained just a little bit of weight that I am happy with, and I just want to get back into working out and taking better care of myself so I can continue to feel confident in my body even throughout the changes it&#8217;s enduring. Right now I&#8217;m trying to work on my lower half and my stomach</em>
</p>
<figure class="embed-grid"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="fitness, workout, and body image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/309132706/superthumb.jpg?t=1521367086"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="motivation, quotes, and fitness image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/327276101/superthumb.jpg?t=1551288515"><figcaption>For almost a week, I&#8217;ve been doing 4 different types of arm weight training workouts and then I do 30 squats and then 20 fire hydrants on each leg. I&#8217;m gradually adding on workouts as I go.</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>4. Shower &amp; Getting Ready</strong>
</p>
<p><em>During my morning shower is when I usually like to shave and get that type of stuff out of the way. I also use my proactive face wash while I&#8217;m in the shower as well. Obviously I moisturize really well and take care of my skin and although we are in quarantine I still like to pick out cute outfits and get ready just to make myself feel cute and confident.</em>

</p>
<div class="article-body js-article-body">
<p>throughout my whole life ive found myself searching for things to be mad about. whether it was telling myself i could have done better or overthinking about what he was really doing, i lost myself.<br />
<br />yes, ive gone through a lot. heartbreak, violence, abuse, loosing my confidence, picking it back up again and then dropping it once more.
</p>
<p>i let my struggles take over who i am as a person. yes they do shape who i am, but they do not define me. i told myself i&#8217;d never have luck in love. i told myself that im not worth it, no man would want to really be with me, nor woman. i locked myself down and settled for the bare minimum because i thought it was all i could get.
</p>
<p>thats where i was wrong. the reason i wasn&#8217;t happy is because i wasn&#8217;t accepting the happiness. every small thing that brought me joy i would shoot down and tell myself that i must be faking my depression then because i shouldn&#8217;t be happy. that i dont deserve the smile. that i should just kill myself right then and there.
</p>
<p>i wasn&#8217;t taking care of myself and i was blaming myself. for everything. every single time i took a blade to my skin i would cry. not out of pain, out of who i am. i told myself i deserved it, when i really deserve happiness. love, glory, to LIVE.
</p>
<p>even though i am at an extreemly tough point in my life. i am happy. because i have chosen love, ive chosen to trust myself and others. i trust in the universe and most importantly, ive accepted that I DESERVE HAPPINESS<br />
<br />and you do too <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
