<blockquote><p>Hi cuties, I’m back!</p></blockquote>
<p>Today I’m back with an article inspired by @anitta_roxo which i found it encouraging and i really wanted to share what i learned in these last three months.
</p>
<p>Since I’ve been in my house for 4 months now due to quarantine i decided that i wanted to build a better version of myself and begin my journey to my goals.
</p>
<p>So let’s start!
</p>

<p>      <img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="advise, aesthetic, and articles image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/344840292/superthumb.jpg?t=1591010616"><span class="article-info"><br><span class="article-title">5 things I learned lately</span><br><small class="article-byline text-overflow-parent"><br><span class="text-overflow"><br>
                by @anitta_roxo<br></span><br></small><br></span>
    </p></div><figcaption>go check her article <3</figcaption></figure><h2>1. Take time for myself<br></h2>
<p>I always thought that your persona it’s a <strong>unique masterpiece</strong> in this world and everyone should have that “time” for themeselves. All the time when talking to my friends I remind them to treat no only their bodies but their whole existence, <strong>everything about them</strong>. However, i always forgot about <strong>myself</strong>.
</p>
<figure class="embed-grid"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="hands, cinema, and grunge image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/341663322/superthumb.jpg?t=1584584204"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="quotes, words, and aesthetic image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/338980351/superthumb.jpg?t=1577928681"></figure><p>I realised that i’ve never spent a day or an hour for my own and i was upset because i was ignoring the first person i should had loved since the beggining. So i really wanted to enjoy those future hours with myself because the past it’s in the past and those lost days sadly i cannot do anything to bring them back.
</p>
<div class="js-doubleclick-ad article-inline-ad" id="article-inline" data-ad-unit="WeHeartIt_Article_Inline" data-ad-size="300x250 300x100" data-ad-collapse="true"></div>
<figure class="embed-grid"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="therapist, quotes, and grunge image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/274501752/superthumb.jpg?t=1484550286"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="kiss, sexual, and love image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/277630133/superthumb.jpg?t=1486667191"></figure><p>I began changing my timetable and my whole rutine to try getting used to it. As a result after two months treating myself I feel far more relaxed and loved (from me to me) like being in complete peace. Everything went from doing a better skin rutine to trying to find calm on my mind.
</p>
<h2>2.To appreciate each moment in your day<br></h2>
<p>I consider myself as an adventurous person who is always up for any activity i’m invited to do. Indeed, where i live it’s considered as one of the most beautiful places of Argentina due to its great variety of fauna and vegetation. Thus maybe that’s why  i can’t get tired of discovering new nature trails and amazing waterfalls.
</p>
<figure class="embed-grid"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="beautiful, slovenia, and travel image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/341107829/superthumb.jpg?t=1583239692"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="Image by tenderly" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/304687495/superthumb.jpg?t=1515167921"></figure><p>Although i’m in quarantine i’m allow to go outside for a period of time so i try to enjoy <strong>everything</strong> of my day doing activities related to nature (<strong>now</strong>). However, this wasn´t like this before, laziness and boredom were completely consuming my energy and willingness of doing activities up to the point i didn’t even get up of bed to at least have breakfast.
</p>
<figure class="embed-grid"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="Image by lujain" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/345586000/superthumb.jpg?t=1592671088"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="Image by Tamara" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/345576639/superthumb.jpg?t=1592649597"></figure><p>This was getting worst but now that i think about it I’ve never realised i was doing literally <strong>nothing</strong> until one day a friend of mine asked me “what do i do in the day” and well that’s when a guilty feeling and anxiety run through my whole body. Nevertheless, i did change that I struggled but hopefully i could learn how to appreciate each magnificent little detail of my day which made me speechless just because of all the moments i took for granted as something valueless. But believe me that while admiring the mountains covered with bright white snow and silence  but only the sound of birds <strong>it is something worthy to experience</strong>.
</p>
<h2>3. Compliment my body<br></h2>
<p>About this topic there are a few points i’m still working on but which i thought they were small victories to include and talk about it. Since i remember i was always told to be a <strong>certain stereotype</strong> that society built and changed through the time.
</p>
<figure class="embed-grid"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="aesthetic, beautiful, and beauty image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/344958695/superthumb.jpg?t=1591274228"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="amazing, beautiful, and girl power image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/318754237/superthumb.jpg?t=1535916898"></figure><p>I grew up thinking that my body wasn’t worthy to love or admire it in front of the mirror. I carried a heavy feeling with me through my whole teen life and at some point i gave up at trying to understand why i couldn’t get rid of this feeling which consumed my confidence, my attitude and self-esteem.
</p>
<figure class="embed-grid"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="Image by Rose Merence" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/344840568/superthumb.jpg?t=1591011265"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="Image by Rajvi" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/345534803/superthumb.jpg?t=1592549746"></figure><p>Honestly, it was a tough battle against my own thoughts controlled by this giant ventriloquist called <strong>society</strong> which was always there to take down everything related to loving myself. It was really frustrating because:
</p>
<ul><li> <strong>Whatever i try on would look horrible when looking at myself in the mirror</strong> </li>
<li> <strong>Avoid going to crowded places</strong></li>
<li> <strong>Being in a terrible mood all day</strong></li>
<li> <strong>Annoyed by being asked why i did wear certain clothes or not entering to the swimming pool</strong></li>
</ul><p>Yes, I was <strong>suffering</strong> inside and i had enough of that so instead of giving up i had a go looking at myself in the mirror and saying <strong>“you are more than enough, you are worthy and beautiful in your own way. Look at that incredible skin colour, look at those big thighs. Wow just oustanding”</strong>.<br><br>Although at first it was hard to finish the sentence i did and i still say it every single morning when i wake up. I <strong>compliment those features</strong> which make me want to hide but how i already wrote i’m still searching for feeling completely sure of each part of my body.
</p>
<figure class="embed-grid"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="beach, beauty, and details image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/341741866/superthumb.jpg?t=1584757806"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="quotes, post, and words image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/285775263/superthumb.jpg?t=1493613522"></figure><p>If you are going through this feeling I want you to know that it’s hard, i know how it feels but please <strong>do not give up</strong> in searching that powerful feeling when looking at yourself in the mirror and saying <strong>¨Bby you are hot, look at you!”</strong>. Have a go with a compliment per day per hour but try it, everything counts. Lastly, be proud of yourself and don’t let anyone define how your body should be, <strong>do you</strong>.
</p>
<blockquote><p>Each one has its own way to battle this, keep going and never regret choosing your own comfort in your temple.</p></blockquote>
<h2>4. Consistency<br></h2>
<p>I’ve been always a curious kid which fall for everything, when i find something interesting or that really catch my eye i get into it and try to know everything about it. I see it as a positive characteristic of my persona but the dark side of it, it’s that i can’t keep up with whatever is it.
</p>
<figure class="embed-grid"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="quotes, concentrate, and time image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/342754975/superthumb.jpg?t=1586795365"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="vintage, stairs, and house image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/116687488/superthumb.jpg?t=1400448921"></figure><p>Fortunately, i have friends and my sister who are all the time remininding me my goals, the reason why i do it and encouraging me to continue my journey to my aims. Until now, i could complete and reach some of my goals which motivate me to keep going. Some of them are:
</p>
<ul><li> <strong>Running 10Km four times a week</strong></li>
<li> <strong>Reach to my 10th day of Chloe Ting challenge</strong></li>
<li> <strong>A year and a half of being vegetarian</strong></li>
<li> <strong>Reminding me to focus on my health</strong></li>
<li> <strong>Finishing to write 10 songs of mine</strong> (i’m utterly proud of this one)</li>
<li> <strong>Read 2 books in a month</strong> (a small victory 🙂 )</li>
</ul><figure class="embed-grid"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="do it, motivation, and sing image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/345560812/superthumb.jpg?t=1592606803"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="quotes, Dream, and motivation image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/339430626/superthumb.jpg?t=1579100146"></figure><p>Well, and so on, but my main point is to encourage you to go for those goals that you maybe have set up. Do not compare yourself with others, <strong>do you</strong> and you’ll see wins.
</p>
<h2>5.  To accept<br></h2>
<p>As a human we have ups and downs in life, and <strong>it’s ok</strong>. Things happen for a reason and  there is always a solution if you are brave and able to see the situation with another perspective. We are not born knowing how to solve or better said <strong>face</strong> tough moments that life want us to confront, and <strong>it’s ok</strong>.
</p>
<figure class="embed-grid"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="boy, sad, and aesthetic image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/289320010/superthumb.jpg?t=1497326458"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="pretty and girl image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/191072297/superthumb.jpg?t=1437944870"></figure><p>This last thing that i learnt i believe it’s one of the most complex features in my life that i <strong>had to understand</strong>. The reason why it’s that I’ve never been strict with my decisions and that allowed people control my life. It’s sad to think about it but i know i should accept how some situations went, accept things i did wrong and also accept people’s reactions and actions. Instead of searching a guilty or an innocent, i <strong>search for a reason why things happen like that</strong> and just accept it because <strong>i can’t do anything about the past</strong> but accept that <strong>i’m the only one who can change the future</strong> to not go through the same situation as well.
</p>
<figure class="embed-grid"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="photography image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/308078482/superthumb.jpg?t=1519767426"><img class="entry-thumbnail" height="250" width="300" alt="accept, positivity, and quotes image" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/345467890/superthumb.jpg?t=1592407621"></figure><blockquote><p>To accept things can be a difficult step but it’s not impossible, at some point we all have hardship situations and <strong>that’s ok</strong>. Once you accept where you are, you’ll be able to understand future scenarios.</p></blockquote>
<p>————————————————————————————————–<br><br>And that’s the end of another article! Hope you had enjoy it and understand it (my english grammar it’s not the best).
